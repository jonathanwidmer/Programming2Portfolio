# Solo Projects Examples / Large Projects:

My individual project: https://github.com/jonathanwidmer/2020programming2Project
> This is my individual project. I didn't really have a solid idea for what I wanted to do, so I made a couple GUI conversion calculators, as well as a music player. It took me so long to figure out how to get the music player to work that I almost gave up on it, but I eventually got it to work.

Number guessing game: https://github.com/jonathanwidmer/Programming2Portfolio/tree/main/projects/NumberGame
> This is a number guessing game where the user guesses a number, but our assignment was to store the users data, such as name, time spent playing the game, etc. and output it to a txt file.

2D array chessboard: https://github.com/jonathanwidmer/Programming2Portfolio/tree/main/projects/ChessBoard
> This project displays a chess board made from a 2D array. This was my introduction to learning about 2D arrays and how to use them.

My programming group project: https://github.com/jonathanwidmer/programmingroupproject
> I was in a group of 4 people, and together we made a project of a game where you traverse through a maze of dinosaurs to reach a goal. It was a lot of fun working on it. We have 2 Windows versions(32 and 64 bit) and a Mac OS version.

Movie theater chapter project: https://github.com/jonathanwidmer/Programming2Portfolio/tree/main/projects/Theater
> I remember this project being really hard for me to complete because I was new to using 2D arrays. I remember it felt really good when I finally finished it and got it to work.

Letter digit project: https://github.com/jonathanwidmer/Programming2Portfolio/tree/main/projects/LetterDigit
> For this project, you type numbers, like on a phone keypad, to see what words it can make. This project uses a HashMap and Sets.

Resistor project: https://github.com/jonathanwidmer/Programming2Portfolio/tree/main/projects/Resistor
> In this project I actually learned about something other than programming, which is resistance, nominal resistance, and tolerance. I also learned how to calculate these values, and I found it really interesting.
